Well since this my second blog that I created, (the first one using vue but i planning using that entirely just for portofolio web) I decided to make this one using rust, since I want to learn rust more deeply and also want to make something useful with it. 

## Why Rust?
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
Well, rust is a systems programming language that focuses on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. It has a strong type system and ownership model that helps prevent common programming errors like null pointer dereferencing. That sentence alone is what would people says and gpt generated but for me I just using it for learn this language and I woulnd't suggest you to do that actually because this is static blog and that means i have to compile again when iam adding new post or edit existing post, and as you know rust compilation is not that fast like other language, but its ok for me.
